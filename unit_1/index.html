	<h1>It's Training Dogs!</h1>
	<p>It's training dogs, hallelujah! We all know that training dogs isn't easy. It takes hard work, consistency, and most of all, patience. But there's no better reward than a furry best friend, especially if they potty outside and obey basic commands!</p>
	<p>It's Training Dogs is both an education resource and a forum setting for people going through dog training to read about training techniques, and connect with others who are training their pups. Let's train our dogs, together!</p>
